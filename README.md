# jotl-deck
Deck tool for Jaws of the Lion. Draw, shuffle, add cards, save and load decks.

**Update**
Currently re-thinking about this being implemented in Python. Continuation of this would require a Python "backend" with a JS "frontend", or a POST -> GET implementation.
Rewriting in Angular would allow for a dynamic view.

Submodules:
